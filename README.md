# Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

Welcome to the **Image Generation with Pre-trained Models** repository! This project demonstrates how to utilize pre-trained generative models like DALL-E-mini and Stable Diffusion to create images from text prompts. These models enable the generation of high-quality images by leveraging powerful deep learning architectures trained on extensive datasets.

## Introduction

This repository provides a framework for generating images from text prompts using pre-trained generative models. It covers how to use models like DALL-E-mini and Stable Diffusion to create visuals directly from text descriptions. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a developer, or a designer, this project offers a hands-on approach to exploring the capabilities of generative AI.
